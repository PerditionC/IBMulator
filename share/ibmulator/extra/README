Useful DOS programs.
Use Turbo C to compile the source files.


## ROMDUMP.EXE
Dumps the PS/1 type 2011 ROM to 1 file (for the US version) or 2 files (for
international versions.)
Put the EXE in a floppy disk with at least 300KiB (US) / 600KiB (intl.) of free
space.
Usage: ROMDUMP us|intl
Use ‘us’ if you have got the US version, use ‘intl’ otherwise.
It shouldn’t do anything wrong, just read from memory, but I have to warn you
that I never tested it on anything else than my italian PS/1.


## CMOSDUMP
A program to dump the content of the CMOS to a file called CMOS.BIN.
Usage: CMOSDUMP


## MEMDUMP
Dumps various memory regions in the lower area (<1MB): 00000-00400, 00400-00500, 
9FC00-A0000, C0000-D0000, D0000-E0000, E0000-F0000, F0000-100000.
Usage: MEMDUMP


## SPKRTONE
Plays a continuous tone through the PC speaker.
Usage: SPKRTONE frequency


## SPKRWAV
Plays a 8bit PCM mono WAV file through the PC speaker.
Usage: SPKRWAV audiofile [frequency]
frequency is optional and if not provided will be automatically detected.
It can also play raw PCM data, which must be in the mono 8bit usigned format. In
this case you need to specify the frequency, otherwise the default value of
16000Hz will be used.


## FDDTEST
Used to perform various low level access tests on real and emulated FDD during 
the development of IBMulator.
It allows the direct access to the floppy drive bypassing the BIOS.
This program can damage the floppy drive if used improperly. For this reason you
need to compile it yourself. You have been warned.


## HDDTEST
Used to perform various tests on real and emulated HDD during the development of
IBMulator.
This program is very dangerous and will wipe (and possibly destroy) your HDD.
You need to compile it yourself, but only after careful analysis of the sources.
You have been warned.
