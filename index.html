<a href="#top"><h2 id="about">About</h2></a>
<p>
IBMulator is a free/libre, open source emulator for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PS/1">IBM PS/1</a>, 
able to run with the original ROM. 
The goal is to create a faithful emulation of the machine, complete of the characteristic 4-quadrant graphical user interface.
</p>
<p>
Currently, IBMulator emulates only the PS/1 model 2011 with the 80286 CPU (sub-models n01, n34, n41.)
</p>
<p>
The program is in active development and still in a beta status. Expect lots of bugs and missing features.
</p>

<a href="#top"><h2 id="features">Features</h2></a>
<ul>
<li>Works with original IBM ROM<br />IBM's peculiar 4-quad GUI and BASIC programming environment included!</li>
<li>PS/1 Audio Card emulation<br />8-bit DAC and a Programmable Sound Generator with 3 voices plus noise.</li>
<li>HDD and floppy emulation<br />You can use standard floppy and hdd images in LBA format, created for example with the <i>dd</i> Linux command.</li>
<li>Realistic timings emulation.<br />The 286 10MHz CPU, the WDL-330P HDD, and the integrated VGA are as painfully slow as in the original, for the truest PS/1 experience. The Prefetch Queue is also emulated, so games like JetFighter work as expected.</li>
<li>OpenGL video output with shaders.<br />The video output can be manipulated with standard GLSL shaders; included is the <a href="http://timothylottes.blogspot.it/2014/08/scanlines.html">CRT shader by Timothy Lottes</a></li>
<li>State recording and resuming.</li>
<li>Runs in Linux and Windows, 64-bit only.</li>
<li>Screenshots and audio WAV capture.</li>
<li>VGM dumping.</li>
<li>Full OpenGL GUI.<br />Dual mode of operation: compact and normal, for an added sense of realism.</li>
<li>Debugging tools.</li>
<li>Multithreaded.<br />OpenGL rendering, CPU core, and sound generation are on separate threads, so your i7 multi-core beast has some spare cycles for overclocking that puny 286.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Currently missing features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Joystick support</li>
<li>MIDI output with redirection to an external sound module (like a real MT-32.)</li>
<li>Optimizations (the implementation is naive in many places.)</li>
<li>Video capture.</li>
<li>Better debugging tools with breakpoints.</li>
<li>OS X support (help needed.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Daydreams</h3>
<ul>
<li>The model 2011 had an ISA Adapter Card Unit, so I'd like to add emulation for AdLib, Sound Blaster, and network cards.</li>
<li>Emulation of the working noise generated by the floppy drive, the hdd, and the system unit.</li>
<li>Full 3D rendering of the system unit with VR support: imagine the possibility to see the PS/1 in front of you!</li>
</ul>

<a href="#top"><h2 id="usage">Usage</h2></a>
<h3>TL;DR version</h3>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ibm+ps%2F1+rom+images">Obtain</a> a ROM set</li>
<li>Launch the program</li>
<li>Edit ibmulator.ini and specify the ROM set name</li>
<li>Relaunch and enjoy</li>
</ol>
<h3>Full version</h3>
<p>
In order to actually use the program you need the original ROM. You have the following options:
</p>
<ul>
<li>if you have a real PS/1, take the program ROMDUMP.EXE in the 'extra' folder and put it in an empty floppy disk; insert the floppy disk in your PS/1 and launch the executable: it will create the ROM image on the floppy disk
<li>or open your PS/1, extract the EPROMs and read them with an EPROM reader (you also need to merge the 2 halves in 1 file, or 4 in 2 if you have a non-US model)
<li>or scour the Internet (there are various ROM sets available.)
</ul>
<p>
If you have the BIN files, create a ROM set (see below for the correct format.)
</p>
<p>
Launch IBMulator. A window will inform you that the file ibmulator.ini has been created and where it is placed.
</p>
<p>
Put the ROM set anywhere you like (inside the same directory of ibmulator.ini is a good place) and update ibmulator.ini with the file name of the ROM set you want to use.
</p>
<p>
You also want to select (or create) the correct keyboard mapping.
</p>
<p>
From now on IBMulator is ready to run.
</p>
<p>
For more information regarding the configuration options, see the comments inside ibmulator.ini.
</p>
<p>
If you want to experiment with VGA shaders, set 'fb-scanlines.fs' in the ini file. It will try to emulate the VGA monitor. In this case, you should also use the compact GUI mode and go fullscreen, otherwise the higher res VGA modes can be a bit blurry.
</p>
<p>
Being a faithful emulator of the PS/1, to configure the system (ie. the PS/1, not the emulator) after a configuration change (for instance, if you add or remove a floppy drive), you need a DOS program called CONFIGUR.EXE, otherwise you'll get various POST errors. Likewise, if you want to customize the way the system works, you need to use the program CUSTOMIZ.EXE. Both files are copyright IBM and you have to search the Internet in order to obtain them.
</p>

<h3>ROM set</h3>
<p>
A ROM set is a compressed file in the ZIP format, containing the binary files of the original ROM. Inside the ZIP file there must be (case insensitive):
</p>
<ul>
<li>FC0000.BIN : the system BIOS ROM, 256KiB
<li>F80000.BIN : the regional ROM, 256KiB, optional, only for the non-US version. For international models, this bin file can be merged with FC0000.BIN to form a single 512KiB bin file. In this case FC0000.BIN, if present, is ignored.
</ul>
<p>
Any other file present in the archive is ignored.
</p>
<h3>HDD image</h3>
<p>
The first time you launch IBMulator, an empty pre-formatted bootable hard disk image will be created.
</p>
<p>
If you have an original PS/1 backup disk-set you can restore the machine to its factory state. In order to do so:
</p>
<ol>
<li>insert a PC-DOS 4.0 floppy disk in drive A
<li>go to the DOS prompt
<li>run "a:restore a: c: /s"
</ol>
<p>
Under Linux you can mount the HDD image using this command:
</p>
<pre>
$ mount -o loop,offset=16896 hdd.img /mnt/loop
</pre>
<p>
The offset value is equal to "start sector"*512. The start sector value can be determined with: 
</p>
<pre>
$ fdisk -l hdd.img
</pre>
<p>
Nota bene: if you change the disk type from the default 35 (WDL-330P) to any other type, the automatically created image will be 0-filled and you'll need to use 'fdisk' and 'format' in order to use it. Also, only types 35 and 38 have accurate timings emulation; any other type have the same performance as type 35.
</p>

<h3>Key bindings</h3>
<ul>
<li>CTRL+F1: show/hide the main interface (only if GUI is in compact mode)
<li>CTRL+F4: show/hide the debug windows
<li>CTRL+F5: take a screenshot
<li>CTRL+F6: start/stop audio capture
<li>CTRL+F10: mouse grab (only if CTRL+F10 is the mouse grab method)
<li>CTRL+F11: CPU emulation speed down
<li>CTRL+F12: CPU emulation speed up
</ul>
<p>
If the grab method is 'MOUSE3', use the central mouse button to lock the mouse.
</p>

<h3>Command line options</h3>
<ul>
<li>-c PATH Sets a configuration file to use
<li>-u PATH Sets a user directory from where the program reads the ini file and stores new files, like screenshots and savestates
<li>-v NUM Sets the verbosity level (from 0 to 2)
</ul>

<a href="#top"><h2 id="FAQ">FAQ</h2></a>
<p>
<b>There are already plenty of emulators. Why another one?</b>
<br />
Why not? Most of the time a FOSS project starts by scratching a developer's personal itch. I had several itches, like: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>I wanted an emulator capable of running the IBM software.</li>
<li>At the time, nobody was interested in emulating the PS/1 audio card.</li>
<li>I was looking for a new spare time software project.</li>
<li>I wanted to learn something new (C++11, multithreading, x86 assembly, PC architecture.)</li>
<li>I always wanted to write an emulator.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Why didn't you contribute to MESS / QEMU / %EmulatorName% instead?</b>
<br />
I did think about it, but ended up voting against. Working in an existing environment, like MESS or QEMU, has its own rather steep learning curve and I'm not an emulation expert nor a C/C++ professional.
</p>

<p>
<b>Why the IBM PS/1, an overpriced, slow PC compatible that was already absolete at launch?</b>
<br />
Nostalgia effect. Also I think that it has some interesting and dinstinctive features like the ROM SHELL.
</p>

<p>
<b>Can I contribute?</b>
<br />
Sure! See below for contact information.
</p>

<p>
<b>Can I reuse your code for %EmulatorName%?</b>
<br />
Yes, as long as you abide by the GPL's terms and conditions. Also, feel free to contact me for information about the PS/1 and its inner workings.
